# WSO2 API Manager Catalog Backend Module

This is the catalog backend module for the **WSO2 API Manager** integration. It provides a Backstage `EntityProvider` that automatically discovers and ingests APIs, API Products, Services, and MCP Servers from WSO2 directly into the Backstage Software Catalog.

> [!IMPORTANT] > **This package is part of the WSO2 suite.**
> Please see the [Main Plugin Page](https://npmjs.com/package/@wso2/backstage-plugin-wso2-api-platform) for full installation and configuration instructions.

## Polling and Scheduling

The ingestion process runs on a customizable schedule, ensuring your Backstage Catalog is always synchronized with your WSO2 environments. The following parameters configure this task:

- **Frequency:** The periodic interval between each catalog ingestion sweep (e.g., `20 minutes`).
- **Timeout:** The maximum allowed duration for a single ingestion task before it is automatically aborted (e.g., `5 minutes`).
- **Initial Delay:** Delays the very first ingestion after the Backstage backend boots up, giving the system time to stabilize (e.g., `15 seconds`).
- **Scope:** Set to `global`. This ensures that only one server or replica in your entire cluster runs the sync task at any given time, preventing race conditions or duplicated API calls.
- **Concurrency:** The provider uses a pool of **5 concurrent workers** to fetch detailed metadata (like swagger definitions or documents) in parallel, dramatically speeding up the ingestion process.

## Discovered REST APIs

During an ingestion sweep, this module connects to multiple WSO2 APIs to discover and build the Backstage entities. The following tables outline the specific endpoints accessed:

_Note: `{publisherBasePath}` typically resolves to `/api/am/publisher/v4`, and `{serviceCatalogBasePath}` resolves to `/api/am/service-catalog/v1`._

## Gateway-only Discovery

Self-hosted gateway discovery (`wso2ApiPlatformGateway`) can run on its own, without the API Manager integration. When `wso2ApiPlatform.enabled` is `false` (or the `wso2ApiPlatform` block is omitted entirely), the provider still sweeps every configured gateway `managementApiUrl` and ingests the discovered APIs; only the API Manager publisher/service-catalog ingestion is skipped. The `catalog.providers.wso2ApiPlatform.schedule` block is still required, as it drives the discovery schedule for both sources.

In gateway-only mode, discovery requests verify TLS with the default system trust store (`wso2ApiPlatform.tls.rejectUnauthorized` only applies to the API Manager client).
